## COMPONENT LIBRARY

* Take a look https://jovial-turing-7fb85d.netlify.com

## ABOUT

* This project is a library of component that were built from a mock. This was built with REACT, JS, CSS.
 
## VISUAL CHOICES 

* Following the Mock provided to us on AdobeXD, the visuals were presented, however...full functionality of the buttons, and forms are present 

## FINAL FEELINGS

* I am happy with this library, though not fully satisfied. I would love to fool around some more making forms and different icon buttons that I could use for future sites. I see the value in having a well structured library with functionality
